Project Overview:
You are tasked with designing and implementing a robust database system for a university. The system should be capable of managing information about students, courses, professors, departments, registrations, and grades.

Requirements:

1. Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):
   - Create a detailed ERD representing the relationships between entities in the university system.
   - Entities: Student, Professor, Course, Department, Registration, Grade.

2. Database Schema Design:
   - Based on the ERD, design a normalized relational database schema for the university system.
   - Define appropriate data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and any necessary constraints.

3. Table Creation (SQL):
   - Write SQL statements to create the tables in the database according to the schema.
   - Include necessary constraints such as foreign key relationships, unique constraints, etc.

4. Data Population:
   - Insert realistic and diverse data into each table to simulate a functioning university database.
   - Include data that covers various scenarios (e.g., multiple courses per professor, multiple students in a course).

5. Queries and Reports:Create a set of complex SQL queries to retrieve meaningful information from the database, such as:
      - List all students enrolled in a specific department.
      - Display the highest and lowest grades for each course.
      - Find courses with a high registration count.

6. Normalization: ( The process of separating your data into tables and creating primary keys is called normalization.)
   - Ensure that the database is normalized.

7. Indexing and Performance Optimization:
   - Implement appropriate indexing on key columns to optimize query performance.
   - Analyze and explain the impact of indexing on query performance.
8. Security Measures:
   - Incorporate basic security measures into the database design (e.g., user roles, access permissions).
